  The prevalence of mental health issues nowadays is a serious issue which has
  become exasperated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our goal is to provide an
  effective UI/UX design for an app that can improve the quality of life of the
  elderly population (65+) in Canada currently suffering from mental health
  issues within the context of COVID-19.
