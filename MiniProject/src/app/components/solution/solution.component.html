  In order to address the rise of mental health issues among the elderly
  population, our team has conducted extensive analysis via online research and
  online surveys. Our findings show that keeping oneself occupied and
  maintaining communication with friends and family through online networks is
  successful in mitigating feelings of loneliness and can lead to an increase in
  happiness during difficult times such as COVID-19.

  In response to these findings, our team has designed an app, <i>BrainFit</i>.
  This application provides users with access different types of games for
  mental exercise and entertainment. It also features that allow users to play
  and chat with friends online. By providing a platform for engagement and
  social interaction, <i>BrainFit</i> aims to reduce feelings of loneliness and
  isolation and contribute to the mental well-being of its users.
