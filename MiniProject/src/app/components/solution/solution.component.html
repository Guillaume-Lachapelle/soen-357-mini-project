  In order to address the rise of mental health issues among the elderly
  population, our team has conducted extensive analysis via online research and
  online surveys. Our findings show that keeping oneself occupied and
  maintaining communication with friends and family through online networks is
  successful in mitigating feelings of loneliness and can lead to an increase in
  happiness during difficult times such as COVID-19. Therefore, our team has
  designed an app where users can access different types of games (for mental
  exercise and for fun) as well as play and chat with friends online.
